# Ford GoBike Dataset Exploration
## by Andrew Ayman

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 183,412 Bike Trips, including 
duration, starting & ending (time, station name, station id, station longitude, station latitude),
user bike id, user type(subscriber or customer), user's birth year, user's gender and bike share on for all the trip .


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the 
duration of the trips and the distance between the start and ending stations.
It's approximately linear between them, while being a customer
or a subscriber doesn't have an affect on the duration cause it 
balances out with the distance, It was a surprize to find out that age doesn't 
have an affect on duration as i expected that young will be faster than adults,
i also proven that cycling is not gender bias and being a male or female 
doesn't have an affect on duration.

I also found out some outliers with in my dataset regarding so low birth year 
which meant not their real age and the outliers from the duration to focus
our exploration on the data that matters.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the distribution of the duration 
as we found out that most people like to travel roughly 5 minutes and
that makes sense cause we humans get tired quickly and if the trip 
would to talk longer it's better to take a ride on a taxi or the subway

Afterwards, I looked on the affect of time on the duration, it was surprising to see that the day doesn't have an affect cause we expected that duration is less on the weekend days as less traffic but no affect but the hour matters cause the duration is least in the early morning(3 - 5 am) cause less traffic to worry about so they move faster
